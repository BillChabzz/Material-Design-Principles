#Material Design

This is a new **visual design** developed by Google alsongside unveiling the "L developer preview"

The principes of material design according to Google are as follows:

1. **Material is the new metaphor** - this is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and system. The material is grounded by reality, 
inspired by our study of paper and ink, yet open to imagination and magic.

2. **Surfaces are intuitive** - surfaces and edges provide visual cues that are grounded in our experience of reality. The use of familiar tactile attributes speaks to primal parts of our brains and helps us quickly understand affordances.
3. **Dimensionality affords interaction** -  the fundamentals of light, surface and movement are key to conveying how objects interact. Realistic lighting shows seams,divides space and indicates moving parets.
4. **One adaptive design** -  a single underlying design system organizes interactions and space.Each device reflects a different view of the same underlying system.Each view is tailored to the size and interaction appropriate for the device.Colors, iconography,hieracrchy and spatial relationships remain constant.
5. **Content is bold, graphic and intentional** - bold design creates hierarchy and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge imagery, large-scale typography and intentional white space create immersion and clarity.
6. **Color,surface and iconography emphasize actions** - user action is the essence of experience design. The primary actions are inflection points that transform the whole design. Their emphasis makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides waypoints for the user.
7. **Users initiate change** - changes in the interface derive their energy from user actions. Motion that cascades from touch respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover.
8. **Animation is choreographed as a shared stage** -  all actions take place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.
9. **Motion provides meaning** -  motion is meanignful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. Feedback is subtle yet clear.
